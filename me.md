A graduate of FSU with a Master's degree in Applied Economics and an undergraduate Bachelor of Science degree in Economics and a Minor in communications. Originally from New York I have lived in Tallahassee for 5 years. I thoroughly enjoyed my time at FSU and I am thankful for all the wonderful professors and peers I had along the way. Economics is my passion and I can't wait to continue my journey.
